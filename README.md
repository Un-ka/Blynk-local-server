# Blynk-local-server
Blynk local server. So far, just a fever file. Perhaps I'll add different versions later.

The creators of blynk removed the local server releases from the github.  But the national memory of him is alive!  Here you will find one of the local server versions and links to other repositories.  Choi is alive and Blynk too!  Freedom to Navalny!
